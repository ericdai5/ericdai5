# Hello! I'm Eric

I graduated from the university of pennsylvania in August 2022, where i studied international relations and computer science. I'm interested in peace and sustainable development through technology and design.

I'm currently trying to learn as much as I can through personal projects. In the past, I've been involved in [@adobe](http://github.com/adobe) as a associate consultant intern on the Document Cloud (2021) team, a business analyst for AI vision start-up [ZeroEyes](https://zeroeyes.com/), and interned at the [U.S. Consulate in Guangzhou, China](https://china.usembassy-china.org.cn/embassy-consulates/guangzhou/), and was active in the Penn social entreprenuership community [PennSEM](https://www.pennsem.org/) serving as Co-President.

Reach out to me at my [email](mailto:ericdai2000@gmail.com) (ericdai2000@gmail.com) if you want to chat or work together!
