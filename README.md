Hello world! </br>

My name is Eric. I'm interested in tools of thought interfaces and human-centered computing. I am a candidate for MSE in Computer Science at Penn. </br>

In the past, I studied international relations at UPenn. Previously, I've been involved in [Adobe](http://github.com/adobe) as a consultant intern on the Document Cloud (2021) team, an analyst for AI vision start-up [ZeroEyes](https://zeroeyes.com/), and served at the [U.S. Consulate in Guangzhou, China](https://china.usembassy-china.org.cn/embassy-consulates/guangzhou/), and was active in the Penn social entreprenuership community [PennSEM](https://www.pennsem.org/).

More on me @ [my website](https://www.ericdai.me/). </br>
